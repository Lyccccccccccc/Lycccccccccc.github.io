# Welcome to Youchuan Liu's personal page

Intro: My name is Youchuan. I'm a Master’s student at Carnegie Mellon University majoring in Computational Design and I finished my undergraduate study in University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I have a great academic performance and am very interested in software design and development. My passion for software engineering drove me to participate and accomplish various course and research projects such as full-stack web application developments, framework and plugin designs and game developments in multiple coding languages like Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, C/C++ and python. This summer, I finished my internship at VMware with a successful experience of developing an actual software product in the agile environment. I'm super enthusiastic and passionate about learning new things and taking challenges, dedicated in work and always helpful to people around.
